      traditions needs to tread the path where the law has to act as catalyst in achieving the goals enshrined in the Constitution as well
      as see India amid one in the galaxy of developed nation.</p>
      
      <br/>
      <p>For achieving these goals enshrined in the Constitution and law being an
      instrument in achieving these goals needs a new perspective for its understanding, dissemination and structural innovations.

      legal education in all its ramifications particularly advocacy, judicial and legal institutional services,
      legislation, law reforms and all the research in these areas .The social and political milieu at present
      requires an interdisciplinary approach for law and its knowledge and obviously in globalized world comparative
      analysis of the law and legal institutions cannot be avoided.</p>

      Indiaâ€™s (BCI) uniform standards but would also develop technological linkages with the technological institutions specially BIT,
      Mesra in whatever filed the law and technology intercept. </p>

      Law and IPR, Law and Genetic Engineering, Law and Genome, Law and Information technology, Law and Medicine, Law and Economics and all such other interrelationships,
